# DAY 17196 (April 4, 1975 - May 2, 2022)
This is a dataset that describes the **changing perspectives** on a **woman's right to choose** in America.

All data are official figures from **Gallup**, formerly known as the American Institute of Public Opinion, that have been compiled and structured by myself. Roe V. Wade

# Data Sources
##### The primary data source used was Gallup, an analytics company renowned for its expansive public opinion polls. With decades worth of data on the sentiments of Americans, Gallup is an organization uniquely equipped to address the shifting attitudes on abortion. 

1. [Gallup's Historical Trends On Abortion](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx) - HRANA published daily updates in English since 10/16/22 on their Twitter, but several days' worth of data was skipped (primarily during early December 2022). 
2. [HRANA's Persian Instagram Account](https://www.instagram.com/hra.news/?hl=en) - HRANA published daily updates in Persian since 10/12/22 on their Instagram, and at a rate far more consistent than HRANA's English Twitter account. I used Google Translate's image scan to read the Persian graphics with the missing data I needed.
